20221220 Don't use 'Survivors: ' in the battlelogger result message, because this is used by ABE_Auswertung.py to identify the vanilla version.
20221220 Don't use Advanced Garbage Collector (It's unnessecary and might cause problems)
20221219 Don't use CSA38 with ABE. (Many error messages are caused by the mod and I suspect it to cause crashes)
20221219 Don't run it in Singleplayer as Pop-up messages will interrupt the execution.
