20221220 Changelog V1.01
  - Added systemTime and Versionnumber to "Battlelogger starting" message.
  - Added Versionnumber, numberOfStartingVehicles, engagementDistance, vehSpacing, breiteGefStr and platoonSize to ""AKBL Result" message.
20221220 Don't use Advanced Garbage Collector (It's unnessecary and might cause problems)
20221219 Don't use CSA38 with ABE. (Many error messages are caused by the mod and I suspect it to cause crashes)
20221219 Don't run it in Singleplayer as Pop-up messages will interrupt the execution.
